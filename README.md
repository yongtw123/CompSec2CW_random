## On how to limit resources

## Optional: how Docker images work
[What are Docker OS images and why would I want to use them in my Dockerfile?](http://artemstar.com/2017/07/23/docker-os-images/)

TLDR; Use OS images with the necessary libraries and binaries built-in!

## The Battleplan
Each person will choose at least 1 case from the 5 as laid out by the authors of paper.
Each person then will implement the code necessary (be it C, C++, Python, Rust, or whatever) to trigger the exploitation.
A very small sample Dockerfile is in `case1`, but obviously there's more to it.

**May the force be with us**
